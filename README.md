## Helpers
There are some helpers node that you can put under a CharacterBody2D and they automatically should work. 
For example MouseFollowMovement, when added to the scene tree, will make your CharacterBody2D follow your mouse. You don't need to write any additional code.
Useful for fast prototiping
